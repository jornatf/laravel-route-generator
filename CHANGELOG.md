All notable changes to `laravel-route-generator` will be documented in this file.

## v1.0.0 - 2023-11-07

In this first version, you can auto-generate route with static blade view.

**Example:** If you create a view in `resources\views\static\example-page.blade.php` you'll have a `GET` route : `/example-page`.
